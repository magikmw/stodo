1.0
* Basic program, as described in README

1.0.1
* Fixed the breakage introduced by newlines in arguments of -a by replacing them with spaces

1.0.2
* New items get tabs instead of spaces in number(tab)dash(tab)data
* Added encoding info to the script for python2, should work now everywhere (Linux)

1.1
* Changed implementation from a simple text file to a SQLite database:
    This makes the application easier to upgrade, with something like tags a matter of few lines.
    HOWEVER this update ignores the existing .stodo file if you had one - need to manually re-add all the records to a new database (just use stodo -a).

1.1.1
* Critical Bug: Attempting to remove items with # higher than 9 throws an error.
* Behind the scenes:
    * Made the code compliant with www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

1.1.2
* Fixed "-c" option not working.
* Fixed some text displaying incorrectly.
