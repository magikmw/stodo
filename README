A small organizational application.
Creates a file (~/.stodo by default) and allows you to append, remove, display
and count items. Fully CLI, interface consists of few simple options.
Easy to embedd in a login MoTD, etc.

Right now the basic program is done. If I find I use it enough, my plans for now
include simple tag interface that would allow for categorization of the entries,
and perhaps a real database integration at some point.

Dependency:
    Requires python3.
    Note that the hashbang in the first line points to python, Arch Linux style.
    With some tweaking it might be possible to run with python2, not sure if
    I used any 3-specific libraries, besides changed syntax.

Installation:
    Put anywhere, set permission to execution and run './stodo'
    OR
    Put anywhere and run with 'python stodo' (or 'python3 stodo')
    OR
    [Comming soon]
    Find on AUR (Arch Linux) and install manually or with your favourite AUR
    pacman wrapper.
